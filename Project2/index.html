    <p>I haven't been using social media a lot lately but I have posted
    pictures from trips that I went on on Facebook as well as hairstyles that
    I've done. I try to keep more personal information private so only my friends
    can see it.</p>
    <p>I have a LinkedIn where I put info about my technical skills,
    education, and classes I've taken but not too much personal info.
    <h2>Thoughts on Data Privacy</h2>
    <p id="special">I try to put the least amount of my info on the web as possible but when it comes to
    people tracking what posts I like or what pages I follow, I don't really
    care.</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://lifehacker.com/your-location-data-isnt-as-anonymous-as-you-think-1840540886">The Times was given access to one such file that
    included data on over 12 million devices from 2016 to 2017, representing a
    total of more than 50 billion individually pinged geographic locations. All
    of these locations can be easily pinpointed on satellite maps, and they
    include...well, everywhere: celebrity homes, secure government facilities
    like the Pentagon, and just about every major city or public location you
    can think of.</blockquote>
    <p>I'm a bit on the fence when it comes to location data though. I
    understand that it could be used for malicious purposes. However, I also am
    worried that I might lose my phone and leaving location services on allows
    me to track my phone if that happens. My family also uses it to locate one
    another if we are out traveling and lost each other. So although it can be
    dangerous, I also think location services can be helpful in certain
    situations. But I don't share my location on social media apps like
    Snapchat since it really isn't necessary for my friends to know where I am
    at all times.</p>
